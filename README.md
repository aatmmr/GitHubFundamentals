## 👥 Audience

This training is for all other roles involved in product development besides developers - like `product owners`, `designers`, or any other type of `stakeholder`. The audience can also contain people completely new to engineering. That's why we try not to use the command-line and do everything in visual tools. The focus of this training are the collaboration features and how to use them effectively.

## ⚡ Prerequisites

For this workshop you need the following:

- A laptop (Windows, Mac, or Linux)
- A free account for [https://github.com](https://github.com/signup)
- It is recommended to have a second screen for the hand-on labs
