## Audience

This training is for all other roles involved in product development besides developers - like `product owners`, `designers`, or any other type of `stakeholder`. The audience can also contain people completely new to engineering. That's why we try not to use the command-line and do everything in visual tools. The focus of this training are the collaboration features and how to use them effectively.
